  <p>Let&#39;s move to the most critical stateful component of your architecture: the PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>For a system with 100,000+ concurrent users, the database is the component where poor SRE planning has the most catastrophic consequences. Unlike stateless Cloud Run services which can be easily scaled and replaced, the database holds your &quot;single source of truth.&quot; Its stability, integrity, and performance are paramount.</p>
<p>We will focus on <strong>Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL</strong>, as it&#39;s the managed service that fits your description.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="sre-plan-cloud-sql-for-postgresql">SRE Plan: Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL</h3>
<p>The database requires an even more rigorous SRE mindset because state is harder to manage than code. Our goals are to prevent data loss, ensure the database is always available for writes and reads, and serve queries quickly.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="1-availability">1. Availability</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure the database is reachable, accepting connections, and available for both reads and writes from your Cloud Run services, with zero data loss on failure.</p>
<h4 id="-slis-what-we-measure-"><strong>SLIs (What We Measure):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Successful Connection Rate:</strong> The percentage of connection attempts from your application&#39;s connection pool that succeed.</li>
<li><strong>Availability Metric from Cloud Monitoring:</strong> The built-in <code>cloudsql.googleapis.com/database/uptime</code> metric, which tracks if the instance is available.</li>
<li><strong>Replication Lag:</strong> The time (or data volume) delay between the primary instance and its replicas (both HA standby and read replicas). A spike here is a leading indicator of problems.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-slos-our-target-"><strong>SLOs (Our Target):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> <strong>99.95%</strong> over a rolling 28-day period.<ul>
<li><em>Why this target?</em> This is the standard SLA for the Cloud SQL HA configuration. It translates to an error budget of ~21 minutes of downtime per month. This is a strong guarantee for a managed relational database.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Recovery Point Objective (RPO):</strong> <strong>0 seconds.</strong> No data loss for a primary instance failure.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery Time Objective (RTO):</strong> <strong>&lt; 3-5 minutes.</strong> The time it takes for an automatic failover to the standby instance to complete.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-how-to-achieve-and-maintain-the-slo-"><strong>How to Achieve and Maintain the SLO:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Enable High Availability (HA) Configuration (Non-Negotiable):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Provision your Cloud SQL instance with the HA option enabled from day one.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> When you create the instance, select the &quot;High Availability (regional)&quot; configuration. This automatically creates a primary instance and a standby instance in a different zone within the same region.</li>
<li><strong>How it Works:</strong> Data is written <em>synchronously</em> to both the primary and standby instance&#39;s persistent disks. If the primary zone or instance fails, Cloud SQL performs an <strong>automatic failover</strong> to the standby instance, which becomes the new primary. Your application&#39;s connection string (using the instance&#39;s IP) remains the same. This single feature is what achieves your RPO of zero.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Automated Backups AND Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Have a multi-layered data recovery strategy. Backups are for disasters; PITR is for correcting smaller operational errors (e.g., a bad <code>DELETE</code> statement).</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong><ul>
<li>Enable <strong>Automated backups</strong>. Schedule them daily during a low-traffic window.</li>
<li>Enable <strong>Point-in-Time Recovery</strong>. This requires write-ahead logs (WAL) to be enabled. It allows you to restore the database to its exact state from any point within your log retention period (typically 7 days).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Cross-Region Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Protect against a full regional outage. While rare, this is a real risk for a high-value enterprise application. HA only protects against zonal failure.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Create a <strong>cross-region read replica</strong> in a secondary region (e.g., if your primary is in <code>us-central1</code>, create the DR replica in <code>us-east1</code>). In the event of a total failure of the primary region, you can manually promote this replica to a standalone, writable instance.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Trade-off:</strong> This failover is <strong>manual</strong> and involves potential data loss (an RPO of seconds to minutes) because cross-region replication is <em>asynchronous</em>. This is an acceptable business risk for a rare disaster scenario.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-latency">2. Latency</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure application queries execute quickly and predictably. Slow queries in the database will cascade, causing latency across all your microservices.</p>
<h4 id="-slis-what-we-measure-"><strong>SLIs (What We Measure):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query Latency:</strong> The p95 and p99 execution time for key business queries, as measured by Cloud SQL Insights.</li>
<li><strong>Connection Latency:</strong> The time it takes for your application to acquire a connection from the pool.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-slos-our-target-"><strong>SLOs (Our Target):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>p95 Latency for Indexed Lookups:</strong> <code>&lt; 10ms</code>.</li>
<li><strong>p99 Latency for Complex Queries:</strong> <code>&lt; 150ms</code>.<ul>
<li><em>Why this target?</em> These are representative targets. Your actual SLOs should be based on your specific application needs. The goal is to ensure that even your &quot;slow path&quot; queries are faster than your overall API latency budget.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-how-to-achieve-and-maintain-the-slo-"><strong>How to Achieve and Maintain the SLO:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Network Proximity and Private IP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Eliminate network latency between Cloud Run and Cloud SQL.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Your Cloud SQL instance <strong>must</strong> be in the <strong>same region</strong> as your Cloud Run services. Connect to it using <strong>Private IP</strong> via the same <strong>Serverless VPC Connector</strong> your Cloud Run services use. This is the single most important factor for latency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Query Optimization &amp; Indexing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Ensure the database isn&#39;t doing unnecessary work.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong><ul>
<li>Use <strong>Cloud SQL Insights</strong>. This is your most powerful tool. It shows you which queries are slow, how often they run, and provides a visual <code>EXPLAIN</code> plan to help you diagnose them.</li>
<li>Proactively add indexes for all <code>WHERE</code>, <code>JOIN</code>, and <code>ORDER BY</code> clauses in your common query patterns.</li>
<li>Your developers must be trained to avoid N+1 query patterns in their code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Right-Sizing the Instance (CPU, RAM, Disk):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Provision enough resources for your workload, especially RAM for caching.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong><ul>
<li>Use <strong>SSD</strong> storage. This is non-negotiable for a transactional database.</li>
<li>Provision enough <strong>RAM</strong> so that your &quot;hot&quot; dataset (frequently accessed tables and indexes) can fit into memory (PostgreSQL&#39;s shared buffers). This turns disk reads into much faster memory reads.</li>
<li>Monitor CPU usage. If it&#39;s consistently high, it may indicate a need for more cores or better query optimization.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-performance-throughput-saturation-">3. Performance (Throughput &amp; Saturation)</h3>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Ensure the database can handle the high volume of queries from your 100k+ users without performance degradation.</p>
<h4 id="-slis-what-we-measure-"><strong>SLIs (What We Measure):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU and Memory Utilization:</strong> Standard signals for instance saturation.</li>
<li><strong>IOPS (Disk I/O Operations Per Second):</strong> Are you hitting the limits of your persistent disk?</li>
<li><strong>Active Connections:</strong> The number of concurrent connections to the database.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-slos-our-target-"><strong>SLOs (Our Target):</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU Utilization:</strong> Maintain peak average below <strong>70%</strong>.<ul>
<li><em>Why this target?</em> This leaves a 30% buffer for usage spikes. Database scaling is vertical (bigger machine) and slower than Cloud Run&#39;s horizontal scaling, so a larger buffer is prudent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-how-to-achieve-and-maintain-the-slo-"><strong>How to Achieve and Maintain the SLO:</strong></h4>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Read Replicas for Scaling Read Traffic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Offload read-heavy workloads from your primary instance to prevent it from becoming a bottleneck.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Create one or more <strong>read replicas</strong> in the same region as your primary. Modify your application&#39;s data access layer to direct all <code>SELECT</code> queries to the replicas&#39; connection pool and all <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code> queries to the primary&#39;s connection pool.</li>
<li><strong>Note:</strong> Be aware of replication lag. Data written to the primary will take milliseconds to seconds to appear on the replicas. Your application must be able to tolerate this eventual consistency for read-heavy workloads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Aggressive Caching with Memorystore (Redis):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Prevent queries from ever hitting the database in the first place. This is the most effective performance strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> Your application architecture already includes Redis. Use it aggressively. Cache frequently read, slowly changing data like user profiles, product catalogs, configuration settings, etc. A request that is served from Redis memory is orders of magnitude faster and cheaper than one served from PostgreSQL.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Effective Connection Pooling (Protecting the DB from the App):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plan:</strong> Prevent your massively scalable Cloud Run services from overwhelming the database with connection requests.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation:</strong> As discussed in the Cloud Run plan, every instance of your application <em>must</em> use a connection pooler. The total number of connections across all your Cloud Run instances (<code>max_instances * pool_size</code>) must not exceed the <code>max_connections</code> limit on your Cloud SQL instance. This is a mathematical certainty you must plan for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
