    <p>Does GCP Apigee also act as load balancer? if so what type of load balancer it is?</p>
  </h1>
  <div class="summary-block">
    This page explores how GCP Apigee functions as an L7 (application layer) load balancer within API management, compares it to traditional load balancers, and details how certificates are managed for secure API traffic.
  </div>
  <p>That&#39;s a very sharp question because the line between an API Gateway and a Load Balancer can be blurry.</p>
  <p>The answer is: <strong>Yes, Apigee performs load balancing, but it is fundamentally an L7 (Application Layer)
      device, not a traditional L4 load balancer.</strong></p>
  <p>It&#39;s more accurate to say that <strong>load balancing is a <em>feature</em> of Apigee</strong>, not its primary
    identity. Its primary identity is as a comprehensive API Management Platform.</p>
  <p>Let&#39;s break down the distinction and what type of load balancer it is.</p>

  <h3 id="how-apigee-performs-load-balancing-its-type-">How Apigee Performs Load Balancing (Its &quot;Type&quot;)</h3>
  <p>When you configure an API proxy in Apigee, you define a <strong>TargetEndpoint</strong>. This is the backend
    service that Apigee will call after it has applied all its policies (security, transformations, etc.).</p>
  <p>Within a single <code>TargetEndpoint</code>, you can define <strong>multiple backend servers</strong>. This is
    where Apigee acts as a load balancer.</p>
  <p><strong>Flow:</strong>
    <code>Client</code> -&gt; <code>Apigee Proxy</code> -&gt; (Security/Policies) -&gt;
    <code>Apigee&#39;s Internal Load Balancer</code> -&gt; <code>One of several Backend Servers</code>
  </p>
  <p>Apigee&#39;s load balancing is of this type:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Type:</strong> <strong>L7 (Application Layer) Load Balancer</strong>
        It operates on the HTTP request <em>after</em> it has been processed. It&#39;s not just forwarding TCP packets;
        it&#39;s making an intelligent routing decision for a fully formed API call.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Configuration:</strong> You define backend servers and the load balancing algorithm within the
        <code>TargetEndpoint</code> configuration, typically in an XML file.</p>
      <pre><code class="lang-xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">TargetEndpoint</span> <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"default"</span>&gt;</span>

        <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Supports <code>RoundRobin</code>, <code>Weighted</code>, and
          <code>LeastConnection</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Health Monitoring:</strong> Apigee actively performs health checks on your backend servers. If a
          server fails its health check, Apigee automatically takes it out of the rotation, preventing calls to a dead
          service. This is a critical load-balancing feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Failover:</strong> You can configure it to automatically retry on another server if one fails.</li>
      </ul>

  </ol>
  <h3 id="typical-gcp-architecture-with-apigee">Typical GCP Architecture with Apigee</h3>
  <p>In a real-world GCP deployment, you don&#39;t typically choose <em>between</em> Apigee and a Google Cloud Load
    Balancer. <strong>You use both, for different purposes.</strong></p>
  <p>A common, robust architecture looks like this:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Client Request:</strong> A user&#39;s device or application makes an API call.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Cloud External HTTPS Load Balancer:</strong> This is the public entry point. Its job is to
      provide a global IP address, handle the initial TLS termination, and protect against DDoS attacks (via Google
      Cloud Armor). It then forwards the traffic to the Apigee instance group.</li>
    <li><strong>GCP Apigee:</strong> Receives the traffic from the Load Balancer. It applies all the API management
      policies:<ul>
        <li>Verifies the API key or OAuth token.</li>
        <li>Enforces rate limiting (quotas).</li>
        <li>Transforms the request if needed.</li>
        <li>Logs the transaction for analytics.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Apigee&#39;s Internal Load Balancer:</strong> Once Apigee is ready to call your backend, it uses its own
      load balancing logic to choose one of your backend service instances (e.g., a Spring Boot application running in a
      GKE cluster).</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Service:</strong> The application receives the request and processes the business logic.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>In summary:</strong> Apigee is a powerful L7 device that includes sophisticated load balancing as part of
    its feature set for managing traffic to backend API servers. However, it is almost always deployed <em>behind</em> a
    dedicated cloud load balancer in a production environment.</p>

  <div>

    <h1>
      <p>With Apigee's load balancing feature, does it involve certificates? How to configure certificates? </p>
    </h1>
    <p>You&#39;re asking about a very important aspect of API security and deployment! Let&#39;s clarify TLS
      certificates and how they integrate with Apigee&#39;s load balancing capabilities.</p>
    <h3 id="what-are-tls-certificates-">What are TLS Certificates?</h3>
    <p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates are digital documents that serve two primary purposes in securing
      internet communication:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> They verify the identity of a server (or sometimes a client in mutual TLS).
        When you visit <code>https://example.com</code>, your browser receives <code>example.com</code>&#39;s TLS
        certificate. It then checks if this certificate was issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and if
        it&#39;s valid for <code>example.com</code>. This ensures you&#39;re talking to the legitimate server, not an
        imposter.</li>
      <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> They contain the server&#39;s public key, which is used during the TLS handshake
        to establish a secure, encrypted communication channel between the client and the server. This ensures that all
        data exchanged (like login credentials, personal information, API requests) remains confidential and cannot be
        intercepted or tampered with.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Key components of a TLS certificate:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> Used for encryption and verifying digital signatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Subject:</strong> The domain name (Common Name - CN) for which the certificate is issued (e.g.,
        <code>api.example.com</code>). It can also include Subject Alternative Names (SANs) for multiple domains or
        subdomains.</li>
      <li><strong>Issuer:</strong> The Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the certificate.</li>
      <li><strong>Validity Period:</strong> The dates between which the certificate is valid.</li>
      <li><strong>Signature:</strong> A digital signature by the CA, which the client uses to verify the
        certificate&#39;s authenticity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Types of TLS certificates (based on validation level):</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Domain Validated (DV):</strong> Easiest and cheapest to obtain, only verifies domain ownership (e.g.,
        via email or DNS record). Suitable for blogs or internal sites.</li>
      <li><strong>Organization Validated (OV):</strong> Requires validation of the organization&#39;s existence and
        domain ownership. Provides more trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Extended Validation (EV):</strong> The highest level of validation, involving a rigorous vetting
        process of the organization. Often displays the company name in the browser&#39;s address bar (though this
        visual cue is less common in modern browsers). Recommended for e-commerce and sensitive data.</li>

    <p>Yes, TLS certificates are absolutely involved when Apigee uses its load balancing feature, and they play a role
      in multiple &quot;hops&quot; of the API request flow. Apigee acts as a reverse proxy and an API gateway, sitting
      between your API consumers and your backend services.</p>
    <p>Let&#39;s break down the two main scenarios where TLS and certificates are involved:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Northbound Traffic (Client to Apigee):</strong> This is the traffic from your API consumers (apps, web
        browsers) to the Apigee Edge or Apigee X runtime.</li>
      <li><strong>Southbound Traffic (Apigee to Backend):</strong> This is the traffic from Apigee to your actual
        backend API services.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="1-northbound-traffic-client-rightarrow-apigee-load-balancer-rightarrow-apigee-runtime-">1. Northbound
      Traffic (Client → Apigee Load Balancer → Apigee Runtime)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Does it involve certificates?</strong> <strong>Yes, definitely.</strong> For clients to securely
        connect to your APIs through Apigee using HTTPS, Apigee (or the load balancer in front of it) must present a
        valid TLS certificate for your API domain.</li>
      <li><strong>TLS Offloading:</strong> In modern Apigee deployments (especially Apigee X on Google Cloud),
        <strong>TLS termination for northbound traffic is typically handled by Google Cloud Load Balancers</strong> that
        sit in front of the Apigee runtime. This is a form of TLS offloading, as discussed previously.<ul>
          <li>The Google Cloud Load Balancer (or an external proxy you configure) holds the TLS certificate and private
            key for your API domain.</li>
          <li>It terminates the client&#39;s HTTPS connection.</li>
          <li>It then forwards the decrypted HTTP traffic to the Apigee runtime instances (Message Processors).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How to Configure Certificates (Northbound):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>For Apigee X:</strong> You manage the TLS certificates on the <strong>Google Cloud Load
              Balancer</strong> that serves your Apigee environment group. This can be done via:<ul>
              <li><strong>Google-managed SSL certificates:</strong> Simplest option. GCP automatically provisions and
                renews certificates for you. You just need to specify your domain.</li>
              <li><strong>Self-managed SSL certificates:</strong> You upload your own certificate and private key
                (obtained from a CA) to Google Cloud&#39;s Certificate Manager or directly to the Load Balancer&#39;s
                SSL certificate configuration.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>For Apigee Edge (Cloud and Private Cloud):</strong> Certificates for northbound traffic are
            typically configured on <strong>Virtual Hosts</strong> within Apigee itself. You would upload your
            certificate and private key into an Apigee <strong>Keystore</strong>. If you need client certificate
            validation (mTLS), you&#39;d also configure a <strong>Truststore</strong> to hold trusted client CAs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="2-southbound-traffic-apigee-runtime-rightarrow-backend-load-balancer-rightarrow-backend-service-">2.
      Southbound Traffic (Apigee Runtime → Backend Load Balancer → Backend Service)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Does it involve certificates?</strong> <strong>Yes, potentially.</strong> This depends on whether your
        backend services are exposed via HTTP or HTTPS. Best practice is to use HTTPS for backend connections,
        especially if the internal network isn&#39;t fully trusted, or for sensitive data.</li>
      <li><strong>TLS Termination at Backend:</strong> If your backend service is secured with HTTPS, Apigee (acting as
        a client to the backend) needs to trust the backend&#39;s TLS certificate.<ul>
          <li><strong>One-way TLS:</strong> Apigee will act as the TLS client and validate the backend server&#39;s
            certificate. For this, Apigee needs a <strong>Truststore</strong> containing the CA certificates that signed
            your backend server&#39;s certificate. If your backend uses publicly trusted certificates, Apigee often has
            built-in trust for those. If it&#39;s a self-signed or internal CA certificate, you&#39;ll need to upload
            the CA chain to an Apigee Truststore.</li>
          <li><strong>Two-way TLS (Mutual TLS - mTLS):</strong> In more secure scenarios, both Apigee and the backend
            authenticate each other. In this case, Apigee acts as both a TLS client (validating the backend&#39;s
            certificate) and a TLS server (presenting its own certificate to the backend for validation).<ul>
              <li>Apigee needs a <strong>Keystore</strong> containing its own certificate and private key to present to
                the backend.</li>
              <li>Apigee needs a <strong>Truststore</strong> containing the CA certificates that signed the
                backend&#39;s certificate.</li>
              <li>The backend also needs its own Keystore and a Truststore containing the CA that signed Apigee&#39;s
                certificate.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>How to Configure Certificates (Southbound):</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Target Endpoints and Target Servers:</strong> In Apigee, you configure the details of your backend
            connections within <strong>Target Endpoints</strong> or <strong>Target Servers</strong> (which are then
            referenced by Target Endpoints).</li>
          <li>Within the <code>HTTPTargetConnection</code> or <code>SSLInfo</code> block of your Target Endpoint/Server,
            you specify:<ul>
              <li><code>&lt;Enabled&gt;true&lt;/Enabled&gt;</code> for SSL.</li>
              <li><code>&lt;TrustStore&gt;</code>: Reference to an Apigee Truststore (containing trusted CA certs for
                the backend).</li>
              <li><code>&lt;KeyStore&gt;</code>: Reference to an Apigee Keystore (containing Apigee&#39;s client
                cert/key for mTLS).</li>
              <li><code>&lt;ClientAuthEnabled&gt;true&lt;/ClientAuthEnabled&gt;</code>: To enable mTLS (if applicable).
              </li>
              <li><code>IgnoreValidationErrors</code>: Option to bypass certain certificate validation errors (use with
                extreme caution, generally for testing only).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Where to manage Keystores and Truststores in Apigee:</strong>
      You create and manage these within the Apigee UI (Admin -&gt; Environments -&gt; Keystores/Truststores) or via
      Apigee Management APIs. You upload your certificate files (PEM, JKS, PKCS12 formats are common) into these stores.
    </p>
    <p><strong>In summary for Apigee:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>API Client ↔ Apigee:</strong> TLS certificates are essential for client trust and encryption. With
        Apigee X, this is typically handled by Google Cloud Load Balancers and configured at that layer. With Apigee
        Edge, it&#39;s configured on Virtual Hosts within Apigee.</li>
      <li><strong>Apigee ↔ Backend:</strong> TLS is highly recommended for security. You configure TLS behavior (one-way
        or two-way, and relevant Keystores/Truststores) on the <strong>Target Endpoints</strong> or <strong>Target
          Servers</strong> within your Apigee API proxy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Proper certificate management, including renewals and secure storage of private keys, is crucial for maintaining
      the security and availability of your APIs.</p>
